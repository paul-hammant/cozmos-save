  <title>Page Editor FireFox extension</title>
</head>


<body>


This extension for Firefox adds an 'Edit' menu option to the 'File'
menu and maps Ctrl-E (or Apple-E) to it so that it can be launched from
a keystroke.<br>

<br>

When invoked, KompoZer or SeaMonkey's Composer (by the
Mozilla
Foundation) will launch for the page in question.&nbsp; You should
install one of them first.<br>


<br>


From there edits can be performed and the page pushed back by the
publish mechanism.<br>


<br>


Here is version 0.9.2 of the firefox plugin.&nbsp; <a href="/downloads/page-editor-0.9.2.xpi">Click to Install</a> <br>


<br>

The extension is not yet fully configurable. It looks for predictable
locations for the executables within the OS in question. In time we
will add the ability to specify the location of the executable for
SeaMonkey and KompoZer.<br>
